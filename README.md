## Lecture Parking Lot

#### What the hell do the `dunders` mean

* `_name` vs `__name` vs `__name__`
* `_name` - If you see this, it means you shouldn't have access to this method. 
	* Similar to how programmers use `private methods` inside Ruby. 
* `__name` - This is used to indicate that this method should NOT be overridden by a subclass. 
* `__name__` - This is to tell you that these methods are being used by Python so don't create any with these names
* If you would like further examples of these three check out [this link](http://igorsobreira.com/2010/09/16/difference-between-one-underline-and-two-underlines-in-python.html)
